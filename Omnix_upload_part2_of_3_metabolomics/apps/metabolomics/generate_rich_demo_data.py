"""
generate_rich_demo_data.py - A richer, standalone example dataset for MetaboAI Pro
(and for general exploration outside the app), distinct from make_sample_data.py's
simpler 4-group demos.

Produces three files:
  1. sample_peak_area_matrix_richdemo.csv  - 200 metabolites x 42 samples
  2. sample_metadata_richdemo.csv          - 42 samples x clinical/demographic variables
  3. metabolite_row_annotations_richdemo.csv - 200 metabolites x Method/Pathway/HMDB_ID

Design:
  - 4 Diagnosis groups (Healthy Control, Prediabetic, Type 2 Diabetes, Metabolic
    Syndrome) x 9 biological samples each = 36, + 6 QC replicates = 42 total.
    "Diagnosis" doubles as the "Group" column the app's stats/PCA/ANOVA logic
    reads, so this drops straight into MetaboAI Pro's single-dataset upload with
    no changes needed -- Age/Gender/Treatment/Ethnicity/Body Weight ride along as
    extra columns the app simply passes through.
  - Metabolites carry a Method (one of 4 analysis types) and Pathway annotation in
    a separate row-annotation file, for external pathway-level interpretation,
    grouping, or filtering -- the app doesn't currently ingest a row-annotation
    file, so this is supplementary reference data, not something app.py reads.
  - Abundance values are realistic-ish: a lognormal per-metabolite baseline, small
    per-sample technical noise, a shared per-pathway "activity" factor per sample
    (so metabolites in the same pathway co-vary -- meaningful for correlation
    analysis), diagnosis-driven fold changes on a differential subset (meaningful
    for ANOVA/heatmap/PCA separation), and a continuous Age/Body-Weight-linked
    effect on a small subset (meaningful for correlation against continuous
    covariates). Missingness is injected with the same tiered scheme as the other
    demos, so Data Cleaning & Imputation has something to do.
